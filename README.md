# The Chef is an Android Mobile Application which is developed in Java and is a hand-book for the recipes.

The user can select the ingredients before selecting recipes so that the user can see what can be made with the ingredients on hand.

If user selects the entire ingredients required for a recipe; the application shows that recipe as "CAN BE MADE RECIPE".
If user does not select all of the required ingredients and selects just a few of them; the application shows that recipe "SUGGESTED RECIPE".
The project is a graduation project at University. But i still work on the development of the project. So keep following!
